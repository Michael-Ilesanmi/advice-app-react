# Advice App
This is a React App that generates advice and displays to the user.
This project is courtesy of a [Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db/hub/advice-generator-app-H13CmHhS9).
The advice is fetched using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) which returns JSON object of an id and advice.
The project was styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
